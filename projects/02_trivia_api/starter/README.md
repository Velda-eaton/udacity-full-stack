# Full Stack API Final Project


## Full Stack Trivia

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out.

The application can:
1. Display questions 
    - all questions 
    - all questions in a given category
    - all questions baised on a search criteria
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

## About the Stack

We started the full stack application for you. It is designed with some key functional areas:

### Backend
>View the [README within ./backend for more details.](./backend/README.md)
The readme file in the backend folder explains how to install and run the back end.  It details all the API endpoints as well as how to test the system.


### Frontend
>View the [README within ./frontend for more details.](./frontend/README.md)
This file has not changed from what was provided.
